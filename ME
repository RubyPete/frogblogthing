<h2 class= "main">  <span class = "first">Ok, so...</span><br>I didn't have an epic day. So, there was this kid in my class, let's call him... <em>hsoJ</em>. So, he came up to my lunch table, and my friend immidiately told him to go away. This is understandable because of the things he's done before. After he doesn't, she contacts a teacher, who asks him to move. When he finally moves, he moves into our "isolation zone", where kids go when they be bad. The teacher then gets mad at my friend. So, who do you think is the antagonist? Leave a comment with "A" before it, and I'll read over it. If you want more details, just ask and I will respond to you. :P  </h2>

    I was having a really good day today. I played "Smash Bros. Ultimate" for the first time today. I played with my friends and even showed them how to code on here. :P<br>But then...<strong>DRAMA</strong>. This "quirky kid" is sitting behind me, and while my friends and I are talking, I feel a hand brush up on my head. I think it was an accident, until about a few minutes later. THIS CHILD STARTS RUBBING MY HAIR. My hair is my pride and joy. So I say as firmly as I ever had at school. <strong>STOP</strong>. He stops, and everyone looks at him. That's really the end of it. I just hope nothing like that happens again. <br>DAY RATING:3.5/5
